#Common terms and writing conventions

Use this style guide in conjunction with other sources of style information, such as a dictionary like [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/), the Microsoft Manual of Style (available in print only), and the [Apple Style Guide](https://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/ASG_2013.pdf). For example, if you want to know how to refer to an item in Mac OS, defer to the term Apple uses for it. This document brings together some of the most commonly encountered terms from those other guides, and may add Mapzen flavor to them.

This list is a living document that will be added to or changed as terminology is encountered. The document is public, so you can also add your own content to it.

##Numbers
- Spell out one through nine unless it precedes a unit or is to be input, write the numerals for 10 and above.

##Computing terms
- You "sign in" or "sign off" when accessing an account. You "log on" or "log out" of a operating system session.
- Hosting within your organization is "on-premises". It always has a hyphen and an -s.
- email is one word, no hyphen.
- File format abbreviations (PDF, JPEG) should be in uppercase, and filename extensions (.pdf, .jpeg) in lowercase.
- filename is one word
- Finder is the application for browsing folders on a Mac. Apple says to use it as "the Finder", not "Finder".
- administrator should not be shortened to "admin"
- plug-in (n., related to extending functionality, such as for a browser) always has a hyphen. Plug in (v.) without a hyphen describes the action of plugging in a cable.

##Abbreviations and acronyms
- Spell out a term if you think the audience does not know it. Put the spelled-out term first and the acronym in parentheses, such as Internet Service Provider (ISP).
- Do not add an apostrophe if you make acronym plural (for example, DVDs not DVD's).
- Abbreviate MB and GB
- Avoid using Latin words, such as e.g., i.e., et al., and etc. Instead, use for example, that is, and others, and so on.

##Titles and headings
- Use sentence-style capitalization (First word capitalized), rather than title case (All Words Capitalized). Sentence-style is easier to read.
- Use imperative verbs, rather than gerunds for titles and headings. For example, name a section, "Add a point to the map", rather than "Adding a point to the map". Imperative is clearer and easier to translate. Nouns are also acceptable for titles and headings.

##Common words
- Because, since - use because for causation (because you checked your email, you saw the meeting invitation) and since for a period of time (it's been hours since you checked email).
