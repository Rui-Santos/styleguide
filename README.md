Styleguide
==========

Mapzen Styleguide makes it easy for us to create right-looking websites that
work well across platforms and into the future. If youâ€™re publishing Mapzen
stuff, the guide is for you.

ðŸ”‹ Batteries included:

* [Basic page structure](https://mapzen.com/common/styleguide/index.html) with
  standard linked CSS and Javascript resources.
* [Sample UI components](https://mapzen.com/common/styleguide/ui-components.html)
  like navigation, social buttons, search boxes, and pagination that can be
  combined to make new kinds of pages.
* [Complete sample pages](https://mapzen.com/common/styleguide/#sample-pages)
  like blog posts and developer documentation showing how all the pieces fit
  together.

If youâ€™d like to edit locally, Styleguide requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
and uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) to generate files in `dist` directory from
sources in `src/site`. Build and test with these commands:

1. `npm install`
2. `gulp build` (or `./node_modules/.bin/gulp build` if _gulp_ not found)
3. `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

Organization
------------

To add a new sub-section to the styleguide:
1. Add a new folder and `index.html` to the appropriate section under `src/site/`
2. Add a new `@@include` to the appropriate HTML file for the section you are working on in `src/site/`
3. Add a new `<a>` link to the index file in `src/site/includes/side-nav.hmtl`
4. Add a new `.scss` file for your sub-section in `src/stylesheets/common`
5. Add a link to your stylesheet in `src/stylesheets/styleguide.scss` so that gulp will bundle it on build
