## Common Mapzen names

- Mapzen: Uppercase only the M. Do not write it as MapZen.
- mapzen.js: Stylized with a dot and lowercase m.
- Turn-by-Turn: the Ts are capitalized, by is not, and there are hyphens in between.
- Time-Distance Matrix: each word is capitalized and there is a hyphen between Time and Distance. Under some style guides, you might use an en dash here, but use a hyphen for simplicity.
- Eraser Map: two words, both capitalized, with a space in between.
- Transitland: Uppercase only the T. Note that the URL is https://transit.land, but use the dot notation only when referring to the website address.

Note: Mapzen products are built on top of several open source projects that we also are active maintainers on. The correct way to discuss this differentiation is to say 'Mapzen Search, powered by Pelias'. 

## Names from other organizations
