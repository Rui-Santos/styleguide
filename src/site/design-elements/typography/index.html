That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now. I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen. Come with me.

  <h3>Text Helpers</h3>
  <p>Both Bootstrap and the Mapzen Styleguide offer several different classes to help you align, transform, and add meaning to your text through color and other treatments.</p>
  <div data-xrayhtml>
    <div class="text-deemphasize">I have been deemphasized / disabled. Nothing to see here.</div>
    <div class="text-muted">I've been muted so as not to distract from the primary message.</div>
    <div class="text-primary">Bootstrap's default "primary" text. (We don't really use this.)</div>
    <div class="text-success">Keep up the good work!</div>
    <div class="text-info">Hey, just to let you know...</div>
    <div class="text-warning">Whoa there, hold your horses.</div>
    <div class="text-danger">Danger, Will Robinson!</div>
  </div>
  <div data-xrayhtml>
    <div class="text-lowercase">lowercase text</div>
    <div class="text-uppercase">uppercase text</div>
    <div class="text-capitalize">capitalized text</div>
  </div>
  <div data-xrayhtml>
    <p class="text-center">Centered text</p>
    <p class="text-left">Left-aligned text</p>
    <p class="text-right">Right-aligned text</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Text-justify really only makes sense with multiple lines of text, as the last line will not expand to fill the entire space. So, here is a short paragraph to show you how it works. How do I look?</p>
    <p class="text-nowrap">This is a long string of text that will not wrap once it hits the other side of its parent container, making it very hard to read.</p>
