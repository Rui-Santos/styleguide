  <h5>Grids</h5>
  <p>
    We use Bootstrap's 12-column responsive grid, on both desktop and mobile, and prebuilt grid classes for layouts that scale and stack based on device and viewport size. Columns allow us to adjust the placement and size of modules within layouts, making the best use of the space available at each breakpoint and maintaining hierarchy within layouts.
  </p>
  <p>
  This is a sample two-column layout where the columns stack using the full width on mobile.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">

          That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.

          <p> We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

  This is a sample three-column layout where only the third column stacks on mobile.

        <p> sRawwwrr! Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. That's one. Uh, General... count me in. I'm with you, too! What is it? Ask me again sometime.

      <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4">
        <p> You are a protocol droid, are you not? I am See-Threepio, human-cy... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages do you speak? I think you'll fit in nicely.

  <p class="caption">(Protip: Pages with text only should not be more than 10 columns wide or text lines become too wide and  hard to read.)</p>

  <p>
    We use the following <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-media-queries">Bootstrap media queries</a>to mark where there are big changes to our grid. This allows us to optimise the page layout for all screen widths across many devices.

    We are currently using the following breakpoints:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Extra Small</strong> - 480px (Phones)</li>
      <li><strong>Small</strong> - 768px (Tablets)</li>
      <li><strong>Medium</strong> - 992px (Desktops)</li>
      <li><strong>Large</strong> - 1200px (Wide Screens)</li>
    </ul>
