  <h5>Tables</h5>

  <p>
    Tables can be written in HTML, as in the snippet below. In projects that support Markdown, tables can be created in <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#tables">GitHub-flavored Markdown syntax</a>, and they will be rendered in the same way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tables can extend horizontally beyond the width of the column it's in. When this happens, a scrollbar is added to allow the table to scroll horizontally without breaking the page layout. To minimize this effect, consider the following content guidelines:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Avoid writing extremely long, unbreakable strings of text, such as <code>very_long_variable_names</code>. You can force variable names to break in the middle of words by applying a <code>.table-word-break</code> class to the table element (not available in Markdown).
    <li>Similarly, avoid showing full URL strings. URLs should be written as links with readable text labels.</li>
    <li>Keep the number of columns to the minimum necessary to convey information. It may be desirable to present information across several tables instead of one large table.</li>
    <li>Not all information is best presented as tables. Consider whether this data is tabular in nature and if there are other ways of presenting it. See the <a href="http://localhost:8080/resources.html#content-guides">content guidelines</a> for more information.</li>
  </ul>
