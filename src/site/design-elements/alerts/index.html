<div id="alerts" class="headroom-large">
  <h2>Alerts</h2>
  <p>Make it clear that an error has occurred (in language the user can understand), and that the user needs to do something. Buttons and links inside alerts should provide the user with a way to solve the problem.</p>
  <p>Inform users of errors in a friendly way. Don’t make them feel bad for making a mistake. Also avoid exclamation marks – this can make the error look more significant than it really is.</p>

  <div data-xrayhtml>
    <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Keep up the good work!</div>
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Hey, just to let you know...</div>
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Whoa there, hold your horses.</div>
    <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">Danger, Will Robinson!</div>
    <div class="alert alert-upsell" role="alert">You should buy this!</div>
  </div>

  <p>If you need to dismiss an alert:</p>
  <div data-xrayhtml>
    <div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible" role="alert">
      <a class="fa fa-times close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close" aria-hidden="true"></a>
      <strong>Warning!</strong> Better check yourself, you're not looking too good.
